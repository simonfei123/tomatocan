          ThinQ.tv is like a Zoom meeting or Google Hangout, except that people can drop in to Conversations from the home page schedule instead of having to be invited with a link. And there is a sidebar for donations. Please browse the current schedule and drop in to any of the Conversations posted. You may also post your own Conversations.

              Post Conversations - Post a time when you'll be at a computer with your ThinQ.tv viewer page open. Tell your members you'll be available for them to drop in and be heard. <br><br>
              Listen - Conversations on all thought-provoking topics are permitted. Weâ€™re fostering a culture of intelligent thought and empathy. We encourage talking with people and listening - a Conversation, rather than the typical norm of internet video where one person talks at the internet. <br><br>
              Donations - Conversation Hosts, such as churches, parents organizations, schools, women's organizations, etc., can receive donations in the sidebar during and after conversations.
