    Our Story
  </h1>
    <p class="black">
      Back when ThinQ.tv Founder & Software Engineer, Dr. Lisa Schaefer, lived in Washington, DC, she attended a meeting where Biz Stone, the founder of Twitter, spoke. All she could thinQ of during the entire meeting was, "I can come up with something better."<br><br>

      Years earlier, Dr. Schaefer had a vision for multi-location book party and discovered live-streaming in its early days. "This changes everything," she thought. Anyone with a computer, webcam, and internet connection can communicate with anyone with anyone else who has an internet connection.<br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer developed her own web platform, embedded video chat, and experimented with talk show formats. Most were awful. People wanted to talk at the internet without listening to others in a dialogue. However the impromptu conversations that followed were worth coming back for.<br><br>

      In July 2019 Dr. Schaefer decided to call the platform ThinQ.tv. She researched video chat apps marketed to teens and young adults and was appalled by the inappropriate and sexual behavior; she wanted to create a platform where this behavior was unacceptable and intellectual conversations were celebrated. When COVID19 hit, more people gathered on ThinQ.tv to talk about substantive topics. Dr. Schaefer gathered college students interested in outreach & tech to host conversations every evening about Women in Tech, Black Lives Matter, and national news.<br><br>

      Since everyone was geographically dispersed & working from home, Dr. Schaefer asked the students to work in chatrooms on ThinQ.tv. It became our office and now we have people in our chatrooms 10 - 14 hours per day. Drop In to share ideas and collaborate on activism.<br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer's brand of activism is Engineering While Female. "Just showing up in spite of the harassment and the assumption that I don't belong here is an act of defiance. If my face goes away, so does my voice. Which leaves a vacuum of leadership for the upcoming generation of women who will follow." <br><br>
