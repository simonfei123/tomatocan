          - Hang out in video chat with other people conducting activism. Drop in & find out who is here! <br>
          - Exchange ideas, get feedback on your designs or activism plans. <br>
          - No agenda. Drop in any time; we'll greet you when you arrive.
          Feel free to work quietly in the chat room to be there for each other when that Aha moment happens.<br>
          - ThinQ.tv is a Woman-Owned tech startup. We are supportive of women & minorities in tech and usually have software engineers and designers in our Drop-In Hours.
